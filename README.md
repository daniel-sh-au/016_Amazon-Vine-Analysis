# Module 16: Big Data

## Overview of the Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge was to analyze the reviews for Video Games sold on Amazon. Using PySpark, the reviews were **extracted** from the [Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt), **transformed** into four seperate dataframes, connected to an AWS RDS instance, and **loaded** into a PostgreSQL database. Then, an analysis was performed to determine if there is any bias from Amazon Vine members for favourable reviews. 

### Resources
